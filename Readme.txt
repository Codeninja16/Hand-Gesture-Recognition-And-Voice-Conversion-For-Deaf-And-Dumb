
Sign language, as one of the most widely used communication means for hearing-impaired people, is expressed by variations of hand-shapes, body movement, and even facial expression. Since it is difficult to collaboratively exploit the information from hand-shapes and body movement trajectory, sign language recognition is still a very challenging task. This paper proposes an effective recognition model to translate sign language into text or speech in order to help the hearing impaired communicate with normal people through sign language. 
Implemented a finger spelling sign language translator. To enable the detection of gestures, we are making use of a Convolutional neural network (CNN). A CNN is highly efficient in tackling computer vision problems and is capable of detecting the desired features with a high degree of accuracy upon sufficient training.
